# Theo-8x-Simulator-
The simulation program written in java for my custom 8-bit cpu design, Theo.

## Use
When starting this program you need to add 2 arguments 'Boot file location' and 'Rom file location', for the included Bootloader and Program 'BOOT.txt' and 'ROM.txt' can be used respectively.
> The Boot file includes the instructions run first on start of the cpu. This will coppy data from the ROM to RAM so the CPU can run the program from RAM.
> The Rom file includes the program run by the CPU.
